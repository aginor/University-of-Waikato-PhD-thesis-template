UoW PhD Thesis Template
=======================

These files are a LaTeX template for PhD theses at the [University of Waikato][1], New Zealand. They are designed for theses in Computer Science but probably work just as well for other departments.

By Andrea Schweer <schweer@cs.waikato.ac.nz> -- use at own risk but in whichever way you want. 

The template follow the regulations in the [Higher Degrees Handbook][2] at its current version (31 August 2010). The files include a [sample output][3] file.

Instructions are in thesis.tex. Replace introduction.tex and conclusions.tex with your own chapters, same for the appendix.
